# LLM-Driven Credit Risk Assessment for Loan Approvals

This project explores the use of **machine learning and LLM-driven signals** for credit risk assessment.  
The workflow combines **structured loan features (LendingClub dataset)** with **text-derived borrower complaint signals (CFPB dataset)** to improve loan approval risk prediction.

## 🚀 Workflow Overview

1. **Data Ingestion**  
   Structured LendingClub loans and CFPB complaint data are loaded and preprocessed into parquet format.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - **Numeric features**: Loan grade, DTI, interest rate, repayment history.  
   - **Text features**: Sentiment & complaint counts aggregated at ZIP3 × Year cohorts.  

3. **Model Training**  
   XGBoost models are trained on:  
   - **Baseline numeric features only**  
   - **Engineered + CFPB text features**  

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**  
   Optuna was used to optimize learning rate, max depth, child weight, etc.  

5. **Evaluation Metrics**  
   Models were assessed via:  
   - ROC Curve & AUC  
   - Precision-Recall Curve  
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Calibration Curve  
   - SHAP feature importance

## 📊 Key Findings

- Adding CFPB-derived sentiment and complaint counts **improved ROC-AUC and PR-AUC by ~1–2%** over the baseline model.  
- SHAP analysis confirmed that **temporal + complaint features** rank alongside traditional credit factors.  
- Calibration improved with Platt scaling, making probabilities more reliable for loan approval thresholds.
